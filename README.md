Interpreting User Needs: Understanding user needs is about listening carefully and turning those needs into clear requirements. "User stories" are key because they succinctly capture what the user wants, keeping the team focused on delivering value.

Program Development Approach: I approach development by breaking down tasks and using Agile processes like Scrum. In the future, I'll emphasize iterative development and regular feedback to stay aligned with user needs.

Being a Good Team Member: A good team member communicates well, supports others, and adapts to changes while staying focused on the team's goals.
